# SoftPlugin config, generated by version ${project.version}

# Each path in this section can be either:
# * Relative, based on the server's running directory (e.g. plugins/SoftPlugin/source/)
# * Absolute, to use a directory anywhere on the system (e.g. C:\SoftPlugin\source)
# SoftPlugin will attempt to create these, if they do not exist
paths:
  # Path that is recursively scanned for Java source files
  # (default: plugins/SoftPlugin/source/)
  source: plugins/SoftPlugin/source/
  # Path that is used for compiled class output
  # (default: plugins/SoftPlugin/cache/)
  cache: plugins/SoftPlugin/cache/

# These settings help SoftPlugin find and load your custom Java code
boot:
  # Fully qualified name of class to attempt to load. It must have a public constructor
  # that accepts an argument of JavaPlugin type.
  # (default: softplugin.Main)
  class: softplugin.Main
